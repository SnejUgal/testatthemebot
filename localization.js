I distinguish two types of issues: *errors* and *warnings*. When I find an error, you should probably fix it, because it may lead to usability decrease.

When I report a warning, it's up to you whether you'll follow it: warnings are recommendations that may improve your theme. But because I'm silly I can't always give you right recommendations.

If you're a developer and you're curious how to test .attheme's by yourself, check out this [npm package](https://npmjs.com/package/attheme-rules) â€” I'm based on this.

If you like me, tell my hoster @snejugal about it. If not, tell him why you don't. This will make me better, making me better makes themes better, better themes make you happy (don't they?) ðŸ˜Š`,

Porting a theme with @themesporterbot, it may leave some variables in purple if it doesn't know an equivalent variable in the desktop theme. Make sure that these variables must be \`#ff00ff\`, if not, fix them.

You have some elements that are invisible in your theme but are really important. You must fix these as soon as possible.
